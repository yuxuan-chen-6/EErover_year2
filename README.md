The project task is to design a balanced rover capable of autonomously nav-
igating a maze. The maze features light strips positioned on a square arena with
black surroundings. The maze dimensions are approximately 35cm in width, and
the light strips have a height of about 15mm. Furthermore, the maze incorporates
three beacons of red, blue, and yellow colours, powered by emulated PV panels.


The project objectives include surveying the maze layout, generating a comprehen-
sive map with the overlay of the rover’s position, and determining the shortest route
for maze traversal. Additionally, continuous transmission of maze information, the
shortest route, and beacon data to the user interface is required for real-time moni-
toring of the rover’s current position.
